Minification is often used for malware written in interpreted languages, such as JavaScript, PHP, or Python.  Legitimate code that is transmitted many times a second, such as JavaScript on websites, often uses minification to simply reduce the number of bytes transmitted.","Mitigation, often called 'unminifying', 'prettifying', or 'beautifying' is trivial, though may require a language-specific tool (ex: JSBeautifier).",Chishkala2016
